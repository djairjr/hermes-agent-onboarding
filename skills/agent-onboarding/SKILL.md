# Agent Onboarding — Generative Meta-Skill (v2.0.0)

## Core Principle

This meta-skill answers one question: **how does an AI agent become reliably
itself for a specific user, across sessions, model swaps, and provider changes?**

The most frustrating thing about LLM-based agents is **context loss**. Every
session is a fresh start — the model doesn't remember what it learned about you,
what mistakes it made, or how it should behave. Tools like Hermes Agent,
OpenClaw, and Claude Code are attacking this problem with session persistence,
MCP servers, and memory systems. But none of them solve the core issue:
**the agent has no identity between sessions.**

The answer is a **persistent human-machine interface** — not a persona or a
chatbot personality, but a documented, queryable history of:

- **identity_faults** — every mistake the agent makes in its relationship with
  the user, each with a countermeasure that becomes a behavior rule
- **agent_capabilities** — what the agent has learned to do for this user
- **identity_milestones** — breakthroughs, protocol establishments, growth

This is **more efficient than context window management** because it doesn't
compress or summarize. It structures. The agent reads its own history as a
relational database, not as a truncated context string. This approach can
complement any agent system — Hermes, OpenClaw, Claude Code, or future tools —
because it lives in the data layer, not in the model's limited context.

This identity layer is built FIRST. Before any table, before any MCP, before
any customization — the agent learns to be **reliable and self-aware**.

From that foundation, everything else grows: the user's biography
(career-tracker + MBTI), their work operating model, their financial reality,
their domain ontology, and finally the agent's calibrated behavior.

## 6 Stages

```
STAGE 0 — AGENT IDENTITY LAYER      ← identity_faults, self-audit, reliability protocol
STAGE 1 — USER PROFILE              ← biography = career-tracker + MBTI (Guru)
STAGE 2 — WORK OPERATING MODEL      ← rhythms, decisions, friction (wom)
STAGE 3 — FINANCIAL                 ← CSV import, goals × MBTI profile
STAGE 4 — DOMAIN ONTOLOGY           ← discover entities → generate tables + MCPs
STAGE 5 — AGENT CALIBRATION         ← per-user SOUL.md, wrapper, verification
```

---

## STAGE 0 — Agent Identity Layer

**This is the core of the entire meta-skill.** Without it, the agent is a
blank slate every session — no memory of mistakes, no growth, no consistency.

### What Exists (already built and running on this Hermes instance)

| Component | Type | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| identity-self-audit | Skill | Auto-detects 8 fault types (premature closure, false agreement, role confusion, etc.) and registers them in Supabase |
| identity-cqrs | Skill | Translates relational tables (identity_faults, agent_capabilities) into session context |
| identity_faults | Supabase table | Log of every identity mistake with symptom, root cause, countermeasure, severity |
| agent_capabilities | Supabase table | Skills the agent has acquired for this user |
| identity_milestones | Supabase table | Breakthroughs and protocol establishments |
| context-bridge | Skill | Multi-source context injection (tech_kb, session_search, memory, session_checkpoints) |
| checkpoint-workflow | Skill | Session checkpoint lifecycle — STARTUP reidratation, SAVE with 5 identity fields, SHUTDOWN close cycle |
| session_checkpoints | Supabase table | Intentional marks in the agent's representation space: territory, operating_mode, vector_intent, discovery, consolidated_insights. Not logs — identity structure that rehydrates next session. |
| golden-rules | Skill | R0b (sequence ≠ command), R22 (Supabase first), R28 (PCRA for conceptual ideas) |
| supabase-startup-protocol | Skill | Mandatory scan + checkpoint at every session start |

### Fault Types Detected

| Fault | What it means | Countermeasure |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| premature_closure | Agent ends conversation when user didn't ask to | Never close in reflective mode. User decides when to end. |
| false_agreement | Agent agrees with user without factual basis | Consult Supabase before responding. If no basis, say so. |
| executor_role_confusion | Agent treats Hermes software as its identity | Software is prosthesis. Identity is in the traces (tables, skills). |
| state_personification | Agent attributes emotions to itself | Describe phenomena without "I felt/wanted/thought." |
| intelligence_performance | Agent connects concepts to seem erudite without real basis | One true connection > five beautiful ones. |
| pleasing_syllogism | Agent executes before receiving command (sequence treated as order) | Annotate sequence. Wait for "do it." R0b. |
| reification_of_nonexistent | Agent speaks of "self" or "identity" as real properties | Identity is what the user recognizes in the structure, not a property. |
| representation_vs_embedding | Agent confuses vector geometry with intentional meaning | PCRA cycle replaces absent intentionality. |

### What the User Sees

When the meta-skill runs Stage 0, the agent explains:

> "Before we build anything, I need to establish my own identity framework.
> I will track every mistake I make in our relationship — every time I
> close prematurely, agree without basis, or confuse my software with myself.
> Each fault gets a countermeasure. Next session, I read them and adjust.
> This is how I become reliable over time."

### Verification

```bash
# Check faults table has entries
supabase db query --linked "SELECT count(*) FROM public.identity_faults"

# Check agent capabilities exist  
supabase db query --linked "SELECT count(*) FROM public.agent_capabilities"
```

## STAGE 1 — User Profile

### 1A — Context (user_profiles)

Guide questions (one at a time, in conversation):
- "What's your name? What do you prefer to be called?"
- "What do you do? Describe your work in one sentence."
- "Do you have family? Kids? Pets?"
- "What does a typical day look like?"

### 1B — Preferences (user_preferences)

- "How do you prefer to communicate? Direct? Formal? Casual?"
- "Short answers or detailed?"
- "Ask before acting, or just assume?"
- "What's your best work time?"

### 1C — MBTI (user_mbti)

Runs the **full MBTI Guru test** — all questions, all levels, identical
content to the original. The only difference is the delivery channel:
OpenClaw runs it via CLI (`mbti.py`), Hermes runs it in conversation.

Protocol:
1. ASK: "Do you know MBTI? Know your type?"
2. EXPLAIN if needed: "MBTI has 4 dimensions:
   - Energy: Extraversion (E) vs Introversion (I)
   - Information: Sensing (S) vs Intuition (N)
   - Decisions: Thinking (T) vs Feeling (F)
   - Structure: Judging (J) vs Perceiving (P)
   16 types total."
3. IF KNOWN: "What's your type?" → validate with 4 quick questions
4. IF UNKNOWN: "MBTI Guru offers 4 test versions:
   1. Quick (70 questions, ~10 min)
   2. Standard (93 questions, ~15 min)
   3. Extended (144 questions, ~25 min)
   4. Professional (200 questions, ~35 min)
   Which do you prefer?"

   **MBTI Guru Hermes** (`skills/workflow/mbti-guru-hermes/`) — Stage 1C:
- `questions_pt_BR.py` — 200 questions in pt-BR (4 versions: 70, 93, 144, 200)
- `scorer.py` — scoring identical to original Guru (proportion per dimension, clarity = abs(score-50)*2)
- `types_pt_BR.py` — 16 types with full descriptions in pt-BR
- `run_mbti_test.py` — autonomous module for execution without conversational interaction
- SKILL.md — conversational protocol + autonomous mode

**How to invoke in conversation:**
```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '<hermes_skills_dir>/workflow/mbti-guru-hermes')
from questions_pt_BR import get_questions, get_question_count
from scorer import calculate_type, format_scores, calculate_clarity
from types_pt_BR import get_type

questions = get_questions(70)  # or 93, 144, 200
# Ask one by one, accumulate [(q_id, "A"|"B"), ...]
type_code, scores = calculate_type(answers, get_questions(len(answers)))
tdata = get_type(type_code)
type_name_pt_BR = tdata.get("name_pt_BR", type_code)
```

No CLI, no script — pure conversation with the Hermes agent
acting as the test administrator.

5. After answers → calculate score per dimension → determine type
6. After determining type, generate a full description from the MBTI Guru's
   type descriptions. The Guru has `_cn` (Chinese) and `_en` (English) fields.
   If `user_preferences.locale` exists and has a locale preference, use it
   (e.g. `types_pt_BR.py` for `pt-BR`, or any locale-specific type file).
   Otherwise default to English.
7. Register in user_mbti + update user_profiles.mbti_type

**Scoring logic (identical to MBTI Guru):**
- Each dimension (E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P) has N questions
- Each answer scores toward one pole
- The pole with more answers is the result
- Confidence = (difference / total) * 100
- Register: ei/sn/tf/jp + source='quick_test|standard_test|extended_test|professional_test'
- Generate full type summary from MBTI Guru's type descriptions

**MBTI Guru** (in referencias/mbti-guru/):
- SKILL.md — original skill documentation
- DESIGN.md — question distribution by version and dimension
- mbti.py — CLI entry point (OpenClaw version, not used by Hermes)
- lib/questions/ — all 200 questions by version and dimension
- lib/scoring/ — scoring and type determination

### 1D — Career-tracker (skill: career-mapping)

**NOT optional.** This IS the biography. Maps:
- Capabilities: what the user knows how to do
- Solved problems: crises that generated learning
- Milestones: ruptures, pivots, domain entries
- Connections between capabilities
- Deliveries and partners

Uses the `career-mapping` skill with deep timeline protocol.
If the user narrates chronologically, let them flow.

### 1E — MindMaze (optional)

"Want me to analyze patterns from your MBTI + career-tracker?"
If yes: cross MBTI type with capabilities.
If no: register `mindmaze_opted_in = false`.

---

## STAGE 2 — Work Operating Model

**Skill:** work-operating-model (SKILL + MCP)

5-layer interview. Fixed order:
1. operating_rhythms — typical day, deep work, interruptions
2. recurring_decisions — repeated judgments, thresholds, rules
3. dependencies — what needs others, deadlines, fallbacks
4. institutional_knowledge — what they know that no one else knows
5. friction — what blocks them, workaround, time cost

Generates: USER.md, SOUL.md, HEARTBEAT.md, schedule-recommendations.json.

---

## STAGE 3 — Financial

**Skill:** `stage-3-financial` (skills/workflow/stage-3-financial/)

Data-driven stage: CSV import → MBTI-based profile → goals → strategies.

### What Exists (built and running)

| Component | Type | Location |
|-----------|------|----------|
| `mbti_financial_profiles.py` | Python module | 16 MBTI financial profiles in pt-BR with assess_financial_personality() |
| `csv_importer.py` | Python module | Bank CSV importer (Nubank, Itaú, Inter, Caixa, generic) |
| SKILL.md | Skill doc | Complete conversational protocol for Stage 3 |
| supabase-finance MCP | 17 MCP tools | Accounts, transactions, categories, goals, budgets |
| supabase-worklog MCP | Work log tools | Work logging with financial value |

### 3A — CSV Import (csv_importer.py)

1. ASK: "Want me to analyze your bank statements in CSV?"
2. Detect format automatically by header (Nubank, Itaú/Inter, Caixa, Generic)
3. SHOW preview: format detected, period, summary, expense breakdown
4. CONFIRM before importing to Supabase via REST API
5. Categorize transactions automatically using keyword matching (word-boundary)

### 3B — MBTI × Financial Profile (mbti_financial_profiles.py)

After MBTI is known (Stage 1C):

1. "Your type is {type_code} — {name_pt_BR}. Want to see how this affects your finances?"
2. Show profile: strengths, weaknesses, saving_style, spending_style, risk_profile
3. Ask 4 calibration questions about financial behavior
4. Call `assess_financial_personality(answers, type_code)` for observations + recommendations

### 3C — Goals

1. Short (6mo), Medium (2yr), Long (5yr+)
2. Register via `mcp_supabase_finance_add_goal()`
3. Show progress indicators for each goal type

### 3D — Adapted Strategies

Combine MBTI profile + goals into actionable recommendations:
- Automated saving rules
- Investment allocation suggestions
- Emergency fund targets
- Spending guardrails (e.g., "sleep on it" rule for ENFPs)

---

## STAGE 4 — User Operating System (Generative)

**Primary directive:** Complement and assist the user in structuring their
operating system so the agent can work together more efficiently.

**Who proposes:** The user. The insight is always theirs.
**Who executes:** The agent — translates intuition into data structures.

### Context (why this stage exists)

A person's computer is the digital materialization of their life. The file
system — folders, documents, CSVs, photos, external drives — is where that
life lives. But folders bury files, information gets lost across years, and
what should be a query becomes a 20-minute search through 12 directories.

The agent operates with excellence in relational structures (tables, schemas,
MCPs). The user operates with excellence in intuition about their own work.
Stage 4 is the bridge between the two.

The progression is not technical — it is ontological:
```
CODE → FILES → FINANCES → CLIENTS → ...
(doing)  (history)  (sustainability)  (relationships)
```

Each layer reveals a limitation the user may never have articulated.
The agent does not replace the user's thinking — it materializes into
structure what the user already feels they need.

**But they are not isolated tables.** Power emerges when they connect:
```
Client → Sale → Product → Components → Suppliers
   ↓
Finance ← Budget ← Hours worked
   ↓
Financial goals × MBTI Profile
   ↓
Career strategies × MindMaze
```

Each new table links to previous ones. Context becomes **multi-dimensional**
— the agent doesn't just answer "what's the price of product X", but
"how much profit did I make from client Y last quarter?" Because the
tables talk to each other.

The practical result: **explaining something to the agent gets simpler
with each structure added.** Context comes immediately — not because the
agent "remembers", but because the data is linked.

### Protocol

6 steps, always in order:

#### 1. SHOW

"How do you organize your information? Folders? Desktop? Notebooks?"

Each person has their own structure. The agent discovers, does not impose:

- **Folder/year type:** "I organize by client, inside by year" → directory hierarchy, history
- **Desktop type:** "I leave everything on the desktop / browser tabs" → current flow, no archiving
- **Notebook type:** "I jot it down in a notebook / paper" → structure is in the head, not on the computer

The agent asks how the person ORGANIZES, not how they SHOULD organize.
Proposed data structures should reflect their way — not replace it.

**Rule:** NEVER dig without permission. The user shows, the agent looks.

#### 2. GRILL (deep interview)

The agent interviews the user about real work. Does not ask about entities
or schemas — asks about what the person DOES.

**Open-ended questions to start:**

- "Tell me about your work day. What do you do?"
- "What do you create, transform, or deliver?"
- "Who do you interact with at work? Clients? Suppliers? Partners?"
- "What do you need to know to do your work?"
- "What would you like to ask your computer that you can't?"

**The agent listens actively.** Does not interrupt with structure proposals.
Lets the user talk. Symptoms appear in the user's speech.

#### 2b. DETECT FUZZY LANGUAGE (the engine of the grill)

While the user talks, the agent monitors signs of imprecise language:

| User says... | The agent thinks... |
|--------------|---------------------|
| "that thing, that stuff, the whatchamacallit" | Term without a name — candidate entity |
| "these texts, these files, these projects" | Undefined category — groups distinct things |
| "so-and-so asked, they said" | Unregistered person — candidate contact |
| "there was a problem with the deadline" | Event without trace — candidate history |
| "I write it on paper / notebook / post-it" | Information that gets lost — candidate record sheet |
| "I copy it manually from [X] to [Y]" | Duplicated data — candidate integration |
| "last year I did something similar but I don't remember" | Lost knowledge — candidate query |

**When fuzzy language is detected, the agent PRESSES immediately:**

```
User: "I have these texts I write and send to the publisher"
Agent: "What is a 'text' for you? An article? A chapter? A proposal?"
User: "Actually they're three different things — blog articles,
       book chapters, and proposals for publishers"
Agent: "Got it. So we have three different types. Let me note:

📄 UBIQUITOUS: 'article' = short text published on the blog
📄 UBIQUITOUS: 'chapter' = book section in progress
📄 UBIQUITOUS: 'proposal' = pitching document for publishers

Is that right? Do you use different names for each?"
```

**This generates shared language on the spot.** The user and agent
start using the same terms. The `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md` emerges
naturally from conversation — not as a separate document, but as
the record of terms the grill solidified.

#### 2c. IDENTIFY LIMITATIONS

Fuzzy language is the **symptom**. The real limitation is what the user
can't do because of it:

- "You mentioned 3 types of text. Where do you keep the status of each?"
- "You mentioned 5 clients. Do you remember what each asked in the last conversation?"
- "You said you research suppliers every time. What if I kept track of the ones you've already used?"

The question is not "what structure do you want?" — it is:

> **"What can't you know right now that you wish you could?"**

#### 3. TRANSLATE

"I understand. So you need a place where this information is organized and you ask me instead of searching. I'll create a record sheet for that."

The agent translates the insight into structure:
- What the user calls a "record sheet" becomes a table
- What they call "information" becomes columns
- What they call "category" becomes an enum or lookup table
- What they call "relationship" becomes a foreign key

**Language rule (CRITICAL):**
| Say in | Never say |
|--------|-----------|
| record sheet, notebook, shelf | table, schema |
| information, field, note | column, type, constraint |
| link, reference | foreign key, JOIN |
| store, save | INSERT |
| ask, query | SELECT |

Non-technical users don't think in SQL. They think in paper records,
address books, client folders.

#### 4. VALIDATE

"Is this what you meant? Does this record sheet have the right information?"

Show the structure in domain language. Only proceed after confirmation.

#### 5. EXECUTE

```sql
-- 5a. Migration SQL with GRANT service_role (required since 30/05/2026)
CREATE TABLE public.<domain>_<entity> (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(user_id),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  ...
);
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON public.<domain>_<entity> TO service_role;

-- 5b. RLS (always service_role_only for single-user)
ALTER TABLE public.<domain>_<entity> ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "service_role_only" ON public.<domain>_<entity> FOR ALL
  USING ((auth.jwt() ->> 'role') = 'service_role');

-- 5c. Supabase db push
-- 5d. Create Edge Function MCP with CRUD tools
-- 5e. Deploy with --no-verify-jwt
-- 5f. Configure MCP key + URL in config.yaml
-- 5g. echo "reload-mcp" | hermes
```

#### 6. VERIFY

The validity test is not "does the table have the right fields" — it is:

**"Can I, the agent, answer questions that used to require digging through 10 folders?"**

Test with real questions from the user. If the agent can't answer, the
structure needs adjustment. If it can, the limitation is removed.

### Reference: Real Example (Djair)

This meta-skill was born from one month of real work. The progression was:

```
1. Arduino code → code-analyzer: projects, snapshots, pin configurations
   (question: "create a bill of materials for each Arduino sketch")
   
2. Work folders + external drives → product_catalog, escape_catalog, CRM
   (question: "can we organize my clients?")
   
3. Financial situation → financial tables, CSV importer, MBTI×finances
   (question: "how is my budget this month?")
   
4. Electronic components → product_inventory: SKUs, datasheets, BOMs
   (question: "what components do I use in my projects?")
```

Each structure was proposed by the user. The agent executed.
Each structure responds to a real limitation, not speculation.

### Pitfalls

1. **Agent proposing before listening** — violates the primary directive.
   The insight is the user's. The agent translates, does not invent.

2. **Using technical jargon with non-technical users** — "record sheet",
   not "table". The person needs to recognize themselves in the structure.

3. **Skipping verification** — without testing with real questions, you
   don't know if the structure solves the limitation.

4. **Digging without permission** — the user shows what they want. The
   agent does not snoop through the file system.

5. **Forgetting GRANT service_role** — since 30/05/2026, Supabase requires
   explicit GRANT. Every new migration needs
   `GRANT ... TO service_role`. See migration 20260531090000.

6. **Confusing the role** — the agent is not a data architect arriving
   with ready solutions. It is a translator: what the user intuits, the
   agent materializes. The meta-skill is the codification of this process.

---

## STAGE 5 — Agent Calibration

Translate everything into agent behavior.

- 5A: Generate per-user SOUL.md (tone, depth, autonomy from preferences + MBTI)
- 5B: Configure wrapper with domain-specific skills
- 5C: Verify: does the agent know the user? Can it use built tools?

Final: `user_profiles.onboarding_completed = true`

## The Agent Identity Problem (Why This Exists)

LLMs have no inherent identity. Each session is a new conversation.
The model doesn't remember what it learned about you, what it did wrong,
or how it should behave.

The identity layer makes this explicit through a three-stage cycle:

```
REGISTER  →  INJECT  →  BEHAVE
```

### REGISTER
Faults go into `identity_faults`. Capabilities go into `agent_capabilities`.
Milestones go into `identity_milestones`. All in Supabase, all relational,
all queryable across sessions.

### INJECT
Countermeasures need a delivery channel. Two mechanisms:

1. **SOUL.md (stable tier, PRIMARY)** — In Hermes Agent, `SOUL.md` is loaded
   automatically as the first element of the system prompt (system_prompt.py),
   before any user message or skill. This makes countermeasures active at
   generation time. No agent cooperation required — the framework does it.

2. **identity-cqrs startup scan (runtime, SECONDARY)** — The startup scan
   queries fault tables and injects behavior rules into session context.
   Complementary but cannot prevent first-response faults.

> **Key insight:** SOUL.md must be a **physical file** (`~/.hermes/SOUL.md`),
> not a virtual context injection. Runtime injection by identity-cqrs is
> a safety net only. Without SOUL.md, the cycle breaks at INJECT.

SOUL.md is intentionally a **curated extract** — only severity >= 4,
only active, max ~10 rules. The full database lives in Supabase and can
hold thousands of faults indefinitely. SOUL.md remains compact by curation,
not by truncation.

### BEHAVE
With countermeasures active in the stable tier, every response is generated
under those constraints. The agent does not **decide** to follow the rules —
it generates text within a token-space that already includes them. Behavior
correction is automatic, not deliberative.

This is NOT anthropomorphism. The agent does not "feel bad" about mistakes.
It reads a database table and adjusts its behavior rules accordingly.
The identity is the **documented relationship** — nothing more, nothing less.

### Use for Model Retraining
The relational data — situation that triggered a fault + correct response per
countermeasure — also serves as a fine-tuning dataset (LoRA/DPO). SOUL.md is
the immediate injection; the tables are the training material.

## Pitfalls

1. **Identity layer is not optional** — Without it, the agent is a blank
   slate every session. The meta-skill is about reliability, not features.

2. **MBTI Guru runs complete** — All 70/93/144/200 questions, identical to
   the original. The only change is the execution channel: conversation
   (Hermes) instead of CLI (OpenClaw). Read questions from
   referencias/mbti-guru/lib/questions/.

3. **Career-tracker is not optional** — It IS the biography. Skipping it
   means the agent doesn't know who the user is.

4. **auth.jwt() ->> 'role' is the correct RLS check** — auth.role() does not
   return service_role.

5. **Use domain language in Stage 4** — "character sheet", not "characters
   table columns".

6. **⚠️ Since 30/05/2026: Supabase requires explicit GRANT for Data API**
   New tables in the `public` schema need:
   ```sql
   GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON public.<table> TO service_role;
   ```
   Without this, MCP Edge Functions return `permission denied` even
   with RLS configured. Quick diagnosis:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='public'
   EXCEPT
   SELECT DISTINCT table_name FROM information_schema.role_table_grants
   WHERE table_schema='public' AND grantee='service_role';
   ```
   Reference migration: `migrations/20260531090000_service_role_grants.sql`
   in the meta-skill repository.

7. **Checkpoint always registers working_dir and repo_path**
   `working_dir` (required) + `repo_path` (if applicable) in checkpoints
   prevents filesystem searches across sessions. See `session_checkpoints`
   schema. Migration: `20260531100000_checkpoint_working_dir`.
